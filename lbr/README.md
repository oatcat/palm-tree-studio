# EAGLE Libraries from SALTED FISH STUDIO

The libraries here are provided as is.

It is the **end user**'s responsibility to ensure correctness and suitablity for a given componet or application. 

All lbrs are created by me and **SOME** are tested on a real PCB. I'm eager to test those untested footprint on a real PCB but sometimes the footprint are created for some other people or/and the project that use the footprint is eventually wasted. If a footprint is tested it will be announced here.

You are welcome to use this library for commercial purposes. For attribution, I ask that when you begin to sell your device using my footprint, you email me with a link to the product being sold. I want bragging rights that I helped (in a very small part) to create your 8th world wonder.
